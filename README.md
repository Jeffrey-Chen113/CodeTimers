# CodeTimers
##By Jeffrey Chen

This project will be using Timers in Processing alongside physical inputs via the potentiometer. I will be making a game that is ripping off flappy bird where the potentiometer will control the speed in which the pipes come in while the keyboard will control the player jumps. The potentiometer timer will control how fast pipes spawn while the keyboard timer will control the duration of the jumps.
